# Help

We hope this tutorial will work for you.

But if it doesn't (the format may not work well for everyone, and that's okay), we encourage to look at [some other resources](resources.md), which might work better for you.

It's also fine to **take a break from time to time**; feel free to read at your own pace.

If you are stuck in a certain part of the tutorial, want some advice, or just wish to chat with us, [the GBDev community chat](https://gbdev.io/chat) is the place to go!
The authors actively participate there so don't be afraid to ask questions!
The `#asm` channel should be the most appropriate to discuss the tutorial.

If you prefer email, you can reach us at `tutorial@<domain>`, where you replace `<domain>` with this website's domain name.
Anti-spam measure, I hope you understand.
