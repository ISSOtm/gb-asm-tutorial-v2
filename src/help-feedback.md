# Help and feedback

If you are stuck in a certain part of the tutorial, want some advice, or just wish to chat with us, [the GBDev community chat](https://gbdev.io/chat) is the place to go!
I actively participate there, and don't be afraid to ask questions!
(The "ASM" channel should be the most appropriate to discuss the tutorial, by the way.)

If you are interested in contributing to or translating the tutorial, thank you!
Follow the link above, I'd be happy to work with you.

Noticed a problem with the tutorial?
Please [check out our issue tracker](https://github.com/gbdev/gb-asm-tutorial/issues); if there is no open issue about your problem, please create a new one, or reach out to us via the link above.

If you prefer email, my address is `tutorial@<domain>`, where you replace `<domain>` with this website's domain name (it ends with `.fr`).
Anti-spam measure, I hope you understand.
