# Input

We have the building blocks of a game here, but we're still lacking player input.
A game that plays itself isn't very much fun, so let's fix that.

Paste this code below your `Main` loop.
Like `Memcpy`, this is a function that can be reused from different places, using the `call` instruction.

```rgbasm,linenos,start={{#line_no_of "" ../../unbricked/input/main.asm:input-routine}}
{{#include ../../unbricked/input/main.asm:input-routine}}
```

Unfortunately, reading input on the Game Boy is fairly involved (as you can see!), and it would be quite difficult to explain what this function does right now.
So, I ask that you make an exception, and trust me that this function *does* read input.
Alright? Good!

Now that we know how to use functions, let's call the `UpdateKeys` function in our main loop to read user input.
`UpdateKeys` writes the held buttons to a location in memory that we called `wCurKeys`, which we can read from after the function returns.
Because of this, we only need to call `UpdateKeys` once per frame.

This is important, because not only is it faster to reload the inputs that we've already processed, but it also means that we will always act on the same inputs, even if the player presses or releases a button mid-frame.

We're going to use the `and` opcode, which we can use to set the zero flag (`z`) to the value of the bit.
We can use this along with the `PADF` constants in hardware.inc to read a particular key.

```rgbasm,linenos,start={{#line_no_of "" ../../unbricked/input/main.asm:main}}
{{#include ../../unbricked/input/main.asm:main}}
```

Now, if you compile the project, you should be able to move the paddle left and right using the d-pad!!
Hooray, we have the beginnings of a game!
