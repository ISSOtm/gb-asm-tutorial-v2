## Other tutorials

- [evie's interrupts tutorial](https://evie.gbdev.io/blog/interrupts.html) should help you understand how to use interrupts, and what they are useful for.
- [tbsp's "Simple GB ASM examples"](https://github.com/tbsp/simple-gb-asm-examples) is a collection of ROMs, each built from a single, fairly short source file.
  If you found this tutorial too abstract and/or want to get your feet wet, this is a good place to go to!
- [GB assembly by example](https://github.com/daid/gameboy-assembly-by-example), Daid's collection of code snippets.
  Consider this a continuation of the tutorial, but without explanations; it's still useful to peruse them and ask about it, they are overall good quality.

## Complements

Did you enjoy the tutorial or one of the above?
The following should prove useful along the rest of your journey!

- [RGBDS' online documentation](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/) is always useful!
  Notably, you'll find [an instruction reference](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/gbz80.7) and [the reference on RGBASM's syntax and features](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/rgbasm.5).
- [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs) are _the_ reference for all Game Boy hardware.
  It's a good idea to consult it if you aare unsure how a register works, or if you're wondering how to do something.
- [gb-optables](https://gbdev.io/gb-opcodes/optables) is a more compact instruction table, it becomes more useful when you stop needing the instructions' descriptions.
