# Roadmap

The tutorial is split into three sections.
**I strongly advise you go through the tutorial in order!**

In Part Ⅰ, we run our first "Hello World!" program, which we then dissect to learn what makes the Game Boy tick.

In Part Ⅱ, we program our first game, a clone of *Arkanoid*; we learn how to prod the hardware into having something we can call a "game".
Along the way, we will make plenty of mistakes, so we can learn how to debug our code.

And finally, Part Ⅲ is about "advanced" use of the hardware, where we learn how to make even better-looking games, and we program a Shoot 'Em Up!

I hope the tutorial will work for you!!
But if it doesn't (the format doesn't work well for everyone, and that's okay), I encourage you to look at [some other resources](resources.md), which might work better for you.
It's also fine to take a break from time to time; feel free to read at your own pace, and to [ask for clarifications](https://gbdev.io/chat) if anything isn't clear to you.

Unfortunately, this tutorial is a work in progress.
Currently, **Part Ⅱ is being written**, and Part Ⅲ should follow soon after.
