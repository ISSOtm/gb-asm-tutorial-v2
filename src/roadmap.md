# Roadmap

The tutorial is split into three parts.
**We strongly advise you go through the tutorial in order!**

In Part Ⅰ, we run our first "Hello World!" program, which we then dissect to learn what makes the Game Boy tick.

In Part Ⅱ, we program our first game, a clone of *Arkanoid*; we learn how to prod the hardware into having something we can call a "game".
Along the way, we will make plenty of mistakes, so we can learn how to debug our code.

And finally, Part Ⅲ is about "advanced" use of the hardware, where we learn how to make even better-looking games, and we program a Shoot 'Em Up!

This tutorial is a work in progress.
