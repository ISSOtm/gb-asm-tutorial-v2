# Enemy Collision

In the previous page, we used a function called `CheckCollisionForCurrentEnemy`. We'll explain and define that function on this page.

There are two parts to enemy collision detection:
- Collision Detection against the player
- Collision Detection against bullets

## Against the Player

Checking agains the player is really simple


## Against bullets
