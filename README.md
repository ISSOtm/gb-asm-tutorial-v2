## Translating

To add a translation or contribute on an existing one, please see [TRANSLATING](TRANSLATING.md).

## Contributing 

Contributing is really easy, fork this repo and edit the files in the **src** directory. Then, you can send your PR.

To deploy gb-asm-tutorial locally:

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook#readme).
  mdBook powers the book itself, Rust is used for some custom plugins.
  ```
  $ cargo install mdbook
  ```
2. Within a terminal pointed at the directory `book.toml` is in, run mdBook (`mdbook build` / `mdbook watch` / `mdbook serve`).
3. The HTML files are in `book/custom/`.

  ⚠️ `book/html/` contains only partially processed files.
  This folder is what gets served when running `mdbook serve`, so you may see some custom markup missing if using that.
  As a workaround, you can manually open the files in the `book/custom/` folder in your browser, they just won't auto-refresh on changes.
