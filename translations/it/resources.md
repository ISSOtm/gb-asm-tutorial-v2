A.k.a. "where to go from here".

FIXME: This is not properly written yet...

- [GBDev community home page](https://gbdev.io) and [chat channels](https://gbdev.io/chat).
- [RGBDS online documentation](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/), this includes [an instruction reference](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/gbz80.7).
- [A more compact instruction table](https://gbdev.io/gb-opcodes/optables), more useful if you're already familiar with the instructions.
- [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs),  which will tell you all about the hardware that I haven't yet.
- [GB assembly by example](https://github.com/daid/gameboy-assembly-by-example), Daid's collection of code snippets. Consider this a continuation of the tutorial, but without explanations; it's still useful to peruse them and ask about it, they are overall good quality.
