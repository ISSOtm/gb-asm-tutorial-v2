# Where to go next

Oh.
Well, you've reached the end of the tutorial...
And yes, as you can see, it's not finished *yet*.
I'm actively working on fixing that, though, please be a little patient :)

In the meantime, the best course of action is to peruse the [resources](resources.html) in the next section, and experiment by yourself.
Well, given that, it may be a good idea to [ask around](help-feedback.html) for advice.
A lot of the problems and questions you will be encountering have already been solved, so others can—and will!—help you getting started faster.
